# stream-countdown-timer
A timer that counts the time until... actually nobody knows what this counts. But you should be able to download the thing and run it on your own web server and import it as a browser source in OBS or Xsplit or whatever.

If you don't want to host it yourself you're welcome to use the one I'm hosting at http://astrocatfreitag.com/code/countdown.html

# installation
Add as a browser source to OBS
look it up if you don't know how to do that
paste in my URL above or your own URL if you're hosting it yourself
right now I recommend using something like 1000x1000 as your size beause this is really really big
erase the custom CSS because I wrote some custom CSS or write your own CSS
  the custom css will hide the text
  this is bad
