# stream-countdown-timer
A timer that counts the time until... actually nobody knows what this counts. But you should be able to download the thing and run it on your own web server and import it as a browser source in OBS or Xsplit or whatever.

If you don't want to host it yourself you're welcome to use the one I'm hosting at https://astrocatfreitag.com/code/stream-countdown-timer/countdown.html. If you download it from me tho you're stuck with my settings that work for my stream. Don't ask me to change it for your stream. You have the source available change it yourself. My version is also subject to random changes at any time or just not working for testing.

# installation
Add as a browser source to OBS

  look it up if you don't know how to do that

paste in my URL above or your own URL if you're hosting it yourself

right now I recommend using something like 1000x1000 as your size beause this is really really big

erase the custom CSS because I wrote some custom CSS or write your own CSS

  the custom css will hide the text
  
  this is bad
  
as currently written, the countdown will fit in an 868x288 size box in OBS
